Why?

I needed a way to work with exif tags on the iPhone. There is already an Objective-C library
called iphone-exif ( http://code.google.com/p/iphone-exif/ ), but this is only available under
the GPL license, which basically means you cannot use it in closed source projects.

libexif is a plain C library created by Lutz Mueller and others, released under the LGPL license.

I didn't manage to get it to build with the provided configure scripts and makefiles, so I created
an Xcode project, which can be integrated with existing Xcode projects more easily.



How?

- Downloaded libexif and exif tarballs from http://libexif.sourceforge.net/
- Configured the libexif build as if it would be built for Mac OS X, as I didn't manage
to configure it to build for iPhone OS. The usual ./configure
- Copied the resulting config.h and added GETTEXT_PACKAGE definition found by browsing the Makefiles
- Copied libexif sources from the libexif tarball
- copied exif-i18n.h/.c and libjpeg sources from exif tarball.
- Added extern "C" blocks to libjpeg/jpeg-data.h to make it work with (Objective-)C++
- Created Xcode static library project, dropped in the sources
- Made sure $(SRCROOT) is in the header search path



License

The Xcode project and test code is in the public domain.
The rest of the code is LGPL
